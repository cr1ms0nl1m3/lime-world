Lime's New World? Sounds great to me

Hello fellow inhabitants of the Earth!

It's me, Lime! Wondering how you all are doing today, and if anyone can teach me javascript before I learn it by myself...
Anyways, I wonder if there are limes that are crimson...
I love most kinds of food, not anything bitter, too sour, or too spicy tho.
